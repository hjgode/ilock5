iLock5 version history

	in progress		
		moved RETAILMSG(1, (buf)); outside if(UseLogging) in nclog.cpp. So it is always active.
		==> tested 3 times with RETAIL build and was OK

		verified: will not hang after cleanboot if used with UseLogging=1
		
		//hangs only if error msg "VSTS.exe Error Message" is in background? NO, on second reboot 
		it does not hang although the error mesg is in background
		
		history file has been reversed
		
		NOT TRUE:[VERFIED: the same executable will block, if compiled with release settings, so we will use the debug builds in future]
		(until we find the real cause)

	version 5.3.0.2
		iLock may keep blocked on end after cleanboot, windows stops sending messages
		to iLock, the progressbar stops (no timer calls), iLock window is disabled
		==>> DID NOT HELP
		
		A DEBUG build works, conditional DEBUG changes:
			in DEBUG, wsa_send is used
			in DEBUG, 
				TIMER4COUNT=3;	//timeout before showing reboot button
				iUseLogging=1;	//use nclog for logging (with sockets) 
			LockTaskbar(false);	//in WM_CREATE
		Added MYDEBUG define and replaced #ifdef DEBUG by #ifdef MYDEBUG, so we get a debug build with no different function
		
		removed IDS_VERSION of resources
		added ver_info to have only ONE source for version number! But as GetVersionFinfo does not work, ver_info.cpp
		has some default prod name and ver info!
